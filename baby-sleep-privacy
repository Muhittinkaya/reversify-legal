PRIVACY POLICY FOR BABY SLEEP SOUNDS
Last Updated: February 14, 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how Baby Sleep Sounds ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application on iOS.
1. Information We Collect
To provide the core features of the App (playing soothing sounds and white noise), we collect very limited data. Unlike many other apps, we do not request access to your location, camera, or microphone.
a. Usage Data & Diagnostics
Purpose: To improve App stability, battery efficiency, and performance, we may collect anonymous crash reports and performance data.
Processing: This data is aggregated and not linked to your personal identity. It helps us fix bugs (e.g., if audio stops playing in the background).
b. Device Settings
Purpose: The App interacts with your device's audio settings (such as volume control and background audio capabilities) to ensure sounds continue playing when the screen is locked.
Processing: This happens locally on your device.
2. Third-Party Advertising & Tracking
To offer this App for free, we will display advertisements provided by third-party networks, such as Google AdMob.
a. Identifiers (IDFA) With your permission, we may access your device’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA) to deliver personalized ads that are more relevant to you (e.g., baby products or parenting tips).
b. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) In accordance with Apple's iOS requirements, we will request your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites for advertising purposes.
Your Choice: You will see a prompt asking for this permission. You can tap "Ask App Not to Track" to decline.
Effect of Declining: If you decline, you will still see advertisements, but they may be less relevant to your interests. The App’s core features (White Noise, Sleep Timers) will remain fully functional.
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We may share anonymous, aggregated usage data with third-party service providers (like Google AdMob) solely for the purpose of displaying advertisements and analyzing App performance.
For more details on how Google AdMob handles data, please review their policy: Google Privacy Policy
4. Children’s Privacy
Target Audience: This App is a utility tool intended for use by parents and guardians to help soothe their babies. It is not designed to be used directly by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from children. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
5. Security
We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. Since the App functions primarily offline (playing locally stored sounds), your usage habits are not transmitted to our servers, except for the anonymous analytics mentioned above.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice.
