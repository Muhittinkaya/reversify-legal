PRIVACY POLICY FOR REVERSIFY
Last updated: December 25, 2025
This Privacy Policy describes how Reversify ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application (the "App").
1. Information We Collect
a. Audio Data (Microphone Usage) Reversify requires access to your device's microphone to function. We use the microphone solely to record the audio clips you create to play the "Reverse Song" game.
Local Processing Only: All audio recordings are processed locally on your device. We do not upload, store, or share your audio recordings on any external server. The recordings are deleted automatically when you close the app or start a new recording.
b. Usage Data & Identifiers (AdMob) We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in our App. AdMob may collect and use personal data, including:
Device Identifiers (such as IDFA) to show personalized ads.
Usage data (e.g., how you interact with ads).
Crash logs and diagnostic information.
2. Third-Party Services
We work with third-party service providers to serve ads. These providers may access your data to perform their services. We encourage you to review their privacy policies:
Google AdMob: https://policies.google.com/privacy
3. App Tracking Transparency (iOS)
On iOS devices, we will request your permission via the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework before tracking your activity for advertising purposes. You can decline this permission, and we will still show you ads, but they may be less relevant to you.
4. Children’s Privacy
Reversify does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can remove it.
5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
