PRIVACY POLICY FOR ZIKIRMATICA
Last updated: January 15, 2026
This Privacy Policy describes how Zikirmatica ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application (the "App").
1. Information We Collect
a. Zikir & Activaity Data (Local Storage) Zikirmatica is designed to help you track your dhikr (remembrance) counts. We collect and store data related to your counters, specifically:
Dhikr names and target numbers.
Daily usage history and count logs (stored for up to 1 month).
Preferences regarding vibration/haptics.
Local Processing Only: All dhikr counts and history data are stored locally on your device (using UserDefaults). We do not upload, store, or share your personal dhikr activity on any external server. If you delete the App, this data will be removed from your device.
b. Usage Data & Identifiers (AdMob) We use Google AdMob to display advertisements (including Banners, Interstitials, and App Open Ads) in our App to keep the basic version free. AdMob may collect and use personal data, including:
Device Identifiers: (such as IDFA on iOS or AAID on Android) to show personalized ads.
Usage Data: Information about how you interact with the ads served.
Diagnostics: Crash logs and performance data.
c. Purchase History (Premium Features) If you choose to purchase Zikirmatica Premium, we process data regarding your purchase history (e.g., active subscription status or lifetime unlock) to enable premium features (such as an ad-free experience). We do not collect or store your payment information (e.g., credit card numbers); all financial transactions are processed securely by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
2. Third-Party Services
We work with third-party service providers to serve ads and handle payments. These providers may access your data to perform their services. We encourage you to review their privacy policies:
Google AdMob: https://policies.google.com/privacy
3. App Tracking Transparency (iOS)
On iOS devices, we will request your permission via the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework before tracking your activity for advertising purposes. You can decline this permission; if you do so, we will still show you ads (unless you have Premium), but they may be less relevant to you.
4. Children’s Privacy
Zikirmatica does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can remove it.
5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
