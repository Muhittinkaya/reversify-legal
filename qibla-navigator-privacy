PRIVACY POLICY FOR QIBLE Navigator: PRAYER TIMES
Last Updated: February 7, 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how Qıble Navigator: Prayer Times ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application on iOS.
1. Information We Collect
To provide the core features of the App (Qibla Navigator and Prayer times), we may request access to certain data on your iOS device.
a. Location Data (Precise Location)
Purpose: We use your location data solely to calculate accurate prayer times and determine the Qibla direction relative to your specific coordinates.
Processing: This calculation is performed locally on your device. We do not store your location history on our servers.
Permissions: You can allow or deny access to Location Services via your iOS settings. If you decline, the App cannot calculate the Qibla direction or prayer times accurately.
b. Device Sensors (Compass & Motion)
Purpose: The App uses data from your device’s magnetometer and accelerometer to display the real-time direction of the Qibla.
Processing: This data is processed in real-time and is not stored.
c. Usage Data & Diagnostics
Purpose: To improve App stability and performance, we may collect anonymous crash reports and performance data. This data is not linked to your identity.
2. Third-Party Advertising & Tracking
To offer this App for free, we will display advertisements provided by third-party networks, such as Google AdMob after the version update.
a. Identifiers (IDFA) With your permission, we may access your device’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA) to deliver personalized ads that are more relevant to you.
b. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) In accordance with Apple's iOS 16+ requirements, we will request your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites for advertising purposes.
Your Choice: You will see a prompt asking for this permission. You can tap "Ask App Not to Track" to decline.
Effect of Declining: If you decline, you will still see advertisements, but they may be less relevant to your interests. The App’s core features (Prayer Times, Qibla) will remain fully functional.
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We may share anonymous, aggregated usage data with third-party service providers (like AdMob) solely for the purpose of displaying advertisements and analyzing App performance.

4. Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from children under the age of 13. The App’s location features are strictly for utility purposes. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
5. Security
We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access. Since location processing for the Qibla feature happens locally on your device, your precise movements are not transmitted to our servers.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice.
